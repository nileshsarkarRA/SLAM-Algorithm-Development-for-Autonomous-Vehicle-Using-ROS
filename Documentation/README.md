# SLAM-Algorithm-Development-for-Autonomous-Vehicle-Using-ROS
# **Project Description:**

This project aims to develop and demonstrate an autonomous navigation system for a small-scale autonomous car using cost-effective hardware. The system will utilize Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques to build a map of the environment while simultaneously determining the vehicle's position within it.

# **Key Features:**

Sensor Fusion: Integration of data from multiple sensors (LiDAR, IMU, Monocular/Stereo/RGB-D camera, Odometer) to enhance perception accuracy, object detection, tracking, and control.

SLAM: Implementation of SLAM algorithms to create a detailed map of the environment and localize the vehicle within it.

Path Planning: Development of algorithms to plan efficient and safe paths for the vehicle to navigate through the environment.
Autonomous Navigation: Demonstration of autonomous navigation capabilities, including obstacle avoidance, goal-reaching, and collision prevention.

# **Technologies and Tools:**

ROS (Robot Operating System): A flexible framework for building robot applications.

ROS2: The next-generation version of ROS, offering improved performance and scalability.

Python: A popular programming language for robotics and machine learning.

C++: A high-performance language used for time-critical tasks in robotics.

OpenCV: A library for computer vision tasks such as image processing and object detection.

Gmapping: A SLAM algorithm for 2D environments.

Cartographer: A SLAM algorithm for 2D and 3D environments.
